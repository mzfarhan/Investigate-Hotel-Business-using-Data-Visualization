# Investigate Hotel Business Visualization

## Description
This project explores hotel booking data using data visualization techniques to gain insights into booking trends, cancellation rates, and customer behavior. It is part of a mini-project for the Rakamin Academy Data Science Bootcamp (Batch 42) by **Muhammad Zulfarhan**.

The analysis helps hotel management understand patterns in customer bookings and provides strategic recommendations based on the findings.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of **119,390** records with **29 features**, including:
- **Hotel Type**
- **Booking Status (is_canceled)**
- **Lead Time**
- **Arrival Date**
- **Number of Guests** (adults, children, babies)
- **Customer Segmentation**

## Features of the Analysis
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summarizing and visualizing the dataset to identify trends.
- **Visualization**: Using Seaborn and Matplotlib for creating insightful plots.
- **Booking Cancellation Analysis**: Understanding the factors influencing cancellations.
- **Customer Behavior Insights**: Analyzing lead times, length of stay, and booking seasonality.
